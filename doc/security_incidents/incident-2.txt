Incident ID: INC-2029-0012

Severity: Critical

Timestamp: 2029-01-15 08:30:00 UTC

Reporter: automated-sentinel-v9

Description: During a routine migration to the New-Era Quantum Encryption standard, a temporary configuration file containing the private lattice-based keys for the global-auth-node was exposed on an internal IPFS gateway.

Impact: Potential for "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks on encrypted legacy traffic.

Actions Taken: Lattice keys rotated. Gateway access protocols updated to Bio-MFA.i
